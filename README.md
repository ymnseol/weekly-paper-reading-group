# 🧑‍🎓 Weekly Paper Reading Group

This repository contains the summaries of papers related to the alignment problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and discussions with [Kyoungwhan Mheen](https://github.com/kwmheen357).  
All the summaries and discussions are either in Korean (한국어) or English.

## Description

### Objective

This covers several papers related to the alignment problem and the methods such as instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) that attempt to solve it.
